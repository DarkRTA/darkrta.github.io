Hi, there is not much here at the moment.

### My Projects

[Local Badges](/LocalBadges) - Addon for FrankerFaceZ that allows one to assign badges to other people locally.

[Î¼TTV](/muTTV.html) - A lightweight client for twitch that avoids the bloat of the website by directly embedding the chat and the player.

### Where I am on various websites:

Twitch [https://twitch.tv/theessenceofdarkness](https://twitch.tv/theessenceofdarkness)

Github: [https://github.com/theessenceofdarkness](https://github.com/theessenceofdarkness) (Do I need to link this?)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/TheD4rkV0id](https://twitter.com/TheD4rkV0id) (My normal username is too long)
