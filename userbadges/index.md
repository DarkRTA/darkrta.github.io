# UserBadges

This is an addon for [FrankerFaceZ](https://frankerfacez.com/) that allows you to assign badges to people locally. Most of the documentation is incldued with the addon itself as a section in FrankerFaceZ's settings menu.

# [Download](userbadges.user.js)

(requires FFZ and a userscript manager)

## Features

* Uses a JSON editor to make configuration easier, while also allowing you to only include stuff you actually need.

* Lets you create a badge and assign it to many users. (obviously)

## Known issues.

* Documentation needs work, and is also a bit unpleasant to look at.

* No way to use a local image file without uploading it somewhere first. (Can use a local web server if desired.).

* Sometimes the editor tends to render incorrectly.

* Editor CSS tweaks are needed in general.

* Needs a page refresh to apply changes. (Will eventually change to not require a page refresh, but a manual reload will still be needed because otherwise it would reload hundreds of times per minute while you are configuring it.)
